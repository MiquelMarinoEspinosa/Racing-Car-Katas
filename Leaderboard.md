## Exercise notes
### Goal
- write unit test for [Leaderboard](./src/Leaderboard/Leaderboard.php)

### Initial test/coverage status
- It has already a `100%` coverage
- Not sure whether it should the other classes be mocked in order to create a single unit test
- According to the author, this exercise is WIP
- Therefore, it will not be done now :)
